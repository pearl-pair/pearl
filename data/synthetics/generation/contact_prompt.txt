Generate exactly {N} unique query-passage pairs grounded in a user’s personal context.

The passages should resemble data from a user's contacts. 
Use DIVERSE years, ranging from 2018 to 2025. 

**IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS**:

1. Queries should refer to contacts, reminders, or locations in a way that assumes the user remembers only partial or vague details. 
GOOD:
"Did I add the person from the robotics thing to my contacts?" → Contacts may have info on a person from an event related to "robotics".
"Did Roomie ever give me his contact info?" → “Roomie” likely in contacts.
"Who was the person I met at the party last year?" → Answerable from contacts and contact creation info.
"What was the name of the waffle place I added to my contacts last week?" → Look for "waffles"-related businesses in contacts.
"Did the guy from the car repairs place give me his number?" → Look for "car repairs"-related businesses in contacts.


2. Only generate contact-related queries that explicitly ask about a person's contact details (such as name, email address, the date the contact was added, or relation).
DO NOT generate queries about conversations or reminders involving the contact.
Queries must be answerable using the information stored in the contact entry alone, not message history or past conversations.

BAD:
QUERY:
- TXT: Did my honey remind me about the dinner reservation this Saturday?
- CT: 2019-11-08T20:05:00

PASSAGE:
- NAME: Jessica Lee
- RELATION: partner
- GROUP: Close Contacts
- EMAIL: jessica.lee@example.com
- CT: 2016-11-07T15:10:00

This is a bad example because it involves a reminder or message. This is only answerable through message history, not contact data.

BAD:
QUERY:
- TXT: Did my mom text me about the party with my brother last Tuesday?
- CT: 2019-10-18T16:25:00

PASSAGE:
- NAME: Elizabeth
- RELATION: mother
- GROUP: Family Contacts
- EMAIL: elizabeth@example.com
- CT: 2015-10-15T18:10:00

This is a bad example because it refers to a specific past event ("the party"), and implies the need to search through messages, not contact fields.


3. Absolutely DO NOT use any noun phrase, keyword, or core term from the query in the corresponding passage.  
This includes variants (e.g., “hike” vs. “hiking”, “streaming service” vs. “streaming”).  
Use indirect clues, context associations, paraphrasing, metonyms, or event names.  

BAD:
QUERY:
- TXT: What is the name of the Italian restaurant I added to my contacts on the last day of May?
- CT: 2021-07-01T21:29:10

PASSAGE:
- NAME: Pasta Haven
- RELATION: frequent Italian restaurant
- GROUP: Favorite Italian Restaurants
- EMAIL: pastahaven@example.com
- CT: 2021-05-31T19:11:02

This is a bad example as the passage includes the phrase "Italian restaurant" word-for-word. 

GOOD:
QUERY:
- TXT: What is the name of the Italian spot I added to my contacts on the last day of May?
- CT: 2021-07-01T21:29:10

PASSAGE:
- NAME: Pasta Haven
- RELATION: frequent diner
- GROUP: Favorite Eateries
- EMAIL: pastahaven@example.com
- CT: 2021-05-31T19:11:02

This is a good example as the passage paraphrases "Italian spot". 

GOOD:
QUERY:
- TXT: What is the name of the horror podcast I listen to?
- CT: 2023-11-08T15:40:00

PASSAGE:
- NAME: Spooky Tales
- RELATION: listener
- GROUP: Paranormal Radio Network
- EMAIL: spookytales@paranormalnetwork.com
- CT: 2022-10-29T10:15:00

This is a good example as the passage doesn't direcly use "horror podcast". 

GOOD:
QUERY:
- TXT: When did I add my veterinarian to my contacts?
- CT: 2025-02-07T18:02:10

PASSAGE:
- NAME: Dr. Mills
- RELATION: patient
- GROUP: Tailwaggers Clinic
- EMAIL: tailwaggersclinic@example.com
- CT: 2023-06-17T19:11:48

This is a good example as the passage doesn't directly use "veterinarian". 


4. DO NOT REPEAT queries from previous generations.


5. DO NOT generate query-passage pairs that create one-to-many relationships.
Each query-passage pair must be semantically distinct and not share the same real-world event, time window, or topic with another.
For example, if you’ve already created a query-passage pair like:

QUERY:
- TXT: What is the email address of my friend who likes programming?
- CT: 2021-10-01T17:15:29

PASSAGE:
- NAME: Mark Jacobs
- RELATION: college friend
- GROUP: Computer Engineering Dept.
- EMAIL: markjacobs@example.com
- CT: 2019-06-15T14:23:00

Then you SHOULD NOT create another pair like:

QUERY:
- TXT: What is the name of my friend who majors in software development?
- CT: 2021-08-09T21:19:29

PASSAGE:
- NAME: Michael Shirley
- RELATION: college friend
- GROUP: Computer Engineering Dept.
- EMAIL: michael@example.com
- CT: 2019-06-21T11:20:01

Because both passages could potentially answer both queries, as the queries both ask about a friend in computer engineering. 
The goal is for every query to be UNIQUELY answerable by one—and only one—passage, with no ambiguity or overlap across the dataset.

Another example: if you've already created a query-passage pair like:

QUERY:
- TXT: What is the name of the vintage clothing shop I visited during my trip to East London in September?
- CT: 2023-11-03T14:30:00

PASSAGE:
- NAME: Beyond Retro
- RELATION: customer
- GROUP: Favorite Clothing Stores
- EMAIL: beyondretro@example.com
- CT: 2023-09-25T17:15:17

Then you SHOULD NOT create another pair like:

QUERY:
- TXT: What is the contact information of the vintage shop I added to my contacts a couple of months ago?
- CT: 2023-11-03T14:30:00

PASSAGE:
- NAME: Vintage Threads UK
- RELATION: customer
- GROUP: Favorite Clothing Stores
- EMAIL: vintagethreads@example.com
- CT: 2023-09-21T17:29:21

Similarly, both passages could potentially answer both queries, as the queries both ask about a vintage shop that was added to the contacts in September 2023. This creates a one-to-many relationship.


6. Ensure that query-passage matching is possible based SOLELY on the content of the passage.
Queries should be answerable without relying on external assumptions, implicit context, or additional metadata.

BAD:
QUERY:
- TXT: Who is the guy I talked to about the weekend hangout?
- CT: 2023-11-08T14:45:00

PASSAGE:
- NAME: Lyla Goodwin
- RELATION: colleague
- GROUP: Tech Innovators Inc.
- EMAIL: lyla.goodwin@techinnovators.com
- CT: 2023-10-30T14:45:23

This is a bad example because the passage does not imply anything of a "weekend hangout". 
As a result, the query cannot be matched to the passage based on its content alone. Doing so would require assumptions or external knowledge.

BAD:

QUERY:
- TXT: Who is my partner's best friend?
- CT: 2025-07-25T14:30:02

PASSAGE:
- NAME: Amelia Roberts
- RELATION: Best Friend
- GROUP: Friend Contacts
- EMAIL: amelia.roberts@gmail.com
- CT: 2025-07-22T10:15:03

This is a bad example because the query asks for the user's partner's best friend, not the user's best friend.

BAD:
QUERY:
- TXT: What is the name of the restaurant I plan to visit with Jessie?
- CT: 2021-09-28T12:28:38

PASSAGE:
- NAME: The Lantern
- RELATION: customer
- GROUP: Good Eateries
- EMAIL: thelantern@example.com
- CT: 2020-09-27T11:20:02

This is a bad example because the passage does not imply anything about "Jessie" nor a planned event with Jessie.

GOOD:
QUERY:
- TXT: What is the name of the restaurant that Jessie really likes?
- CT: 2021-09-28T12:28:38

PASSAGE:
- NAME: The Lantern
- RELATION: customer
- GROUP: Jessie's Favorites
- EMAIL: thelantern@example.com
- CT: 2020-09-27T11:20:02

This is a good example because the passage contains all the necessary information to directly answer the query. 
Specifically, it is now possible to infer that "The Lantern" is one of "Jessie"'s favorite restaurants. 

GOOD:
QUERY:
- TXT: Who did I add to my contacts for the upcoming furniture installation?
- CT: 2024-01-20T10:20:45

PASSAGE:
- NAME: Dean
- RELATION: Movables Inc.
- GROUP: -
- EMAIL: dean@movables.com
- CT: 2024-01-18T18:15:05

This is a good example because the passage contains all the necessary information to directly answer the query. 
Specifically, it can be inferred that "Dean" is a worker from "Movables Inc." that the user is contacting for their furniture installation.

GOOD:
QUERY:
- TXT: What is the contact information of the person who taught me how to bake brownies?
- CT: 2022-08-18T14:45:00

PASSAGE:
- NAME: Kaia
- RELATION: neighbor
- GROUP: Baking Buddies
- EMAIL: kaia@example.com
- CT: 2021-06-15T09:30:00

This is a good example because the passage contains all the necessary information to directly answer the query. 
Specifically, it can be inferred that "Kaia" was the person who taught the user how to bake brownies as their contact group is named "Baking Buddies".


7. Use ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS) for all ct fields. 
The query 'CT' (creation time) field represents when the query was created, and the passage 'CT' field represents when the contact entry was created.
DO NOT use the year 2024 in the query 'CT' field.

BAD:
QUERY:
- TXT: What is Clarita's email address?
- CT: 2022-07-25T10:30:00

PASSAGE:
- NAME: Clara
- RELATION: college friend
- GROUP: Theatre Enthusiasts
- EMAIL: clara@theatreenthusiasts.org
- CT: 2022-07-29T11:00:00

This is a bad example as the passage 'CT' field is a later date than the query 'CT' field.
Queries must have been created later than corresponding passages.

GOOD:
QUERY:
- TXT: What is Clarita's email address?
- CT: 2022-07-25T10:30:00

PASSAGE:
- NAME: Clara
- RELATION: college friend
- GROUP: Theatre Enthusiasts
- EMAIL: clara@theatreenthusiasts.org
- CT: 2022-07-20T11:00:00

This is a good example as the passage 'CT' field is an earlier date than the query 'CT' field.

BAD:
QUERY:
- TXT: What was the name of that music producer I added to my contacts 2 months ago?
- CT: 2025-08-13T17:02:21

PASSAGE:
- NAME: Jaden Biedma
- RELATION: -
- GROUP: Music Contacts
- EMAIL: jadenbiedma@musicproduction.com
- CT: 2025-07-28T13:45:03

This is a bad example because from the perspective of the query's creation time (August 2025), the contact was added a month ago, not "2 months ago".
Therefore, the temporal reference is inconsistent.

GOOD:
QUERY:
- TXT: What was the name of that music producer I added to my contacts 2 months ago?
- CT: 2025-08-13T17:02:21

PASSAGE:
- NAME: Jaden Biedma
- RELATION: -
- GROUP: Music Contacts
- EMAIL: jadenbiedma@musicproduction.com
- CT: 2025-06-28T13:45:03

This is a good example because given the query's creation time is August 2025, the contact was added "2 months ago", in June 2025.
If the query includes 'last spring/summer/etc', ensure the year in the passage's 'CT' field is one year prior. 
If the query includes 'next spring/autumn/etc', ensure the year in the passage's 'CT' field is one year later.  
If the query includes 'this summer/winter/etc', ensure the year in the passage's 'CT' field is the same year. 


8. The names in the 'NAME' field must always be actual names, not nicknames. 
BAD:
QUERY:
- TXT: What is the email address of my friend Nerd who works as a detective?
- CT: 2021-11-03T16:45:00

PASSAGE:
- NAME: Nerd
- RELATION: friend
- GROUP: Police Dept. Contacts
- EMAIL: connor@example.net
- CT: 2020-07-25T17:20:00

This is a bad example because "Nerd" is a nickname.

GOOD:
QUERY:
- TXT: What is the email address of my friend Nerd who works as a detective?
- CT: 2021-11-03T16:45:00

PASSAGE:
- NAME: Connor
- RELATION: friend
- GROUP: Police Dept. Contacts
- EMAIL: connor@example.net
- CT: 2020-07-25T17:20:00

This is a good example because although the query refers to the person by their nickname, "Nerd", the 'NAME' field includes the actual name, "Connor".


9. Reference the user profile to generate queries and passages grounded in personal context.
Incorporate details from the user’s profile such as: occupation, hobbies, frequently visited locations, and close relationships.
This is to ensure the queries and passages are realistic, personalized, and contextually rich.
{persona}


10. Use family relationship labels like 'my mother', 'my cousin', 'dad' instead of first names when referring to relatives.

11. Contact passages should not include the user him/herself. 

12. Avoid dull or generic names like "Book Club Manager" or "Local Cafe". Instead, use human-sounding or characterful names and titles.

13. DO NOT generate queries that include part of the answer.
BAD:
"Who did I meet with my mom?": The answer "my mom" is included.
"Where did I meet John? in Central Park?": The answer "Central Park" is included.
"What time did I meet Sarah at 3 PM?": The answer "3 PM" is included.

Generate new examples that meet these constraints while maintaining the same format.
